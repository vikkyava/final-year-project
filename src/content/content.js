History
The Engineering programmes of the Kwara State University commenced a year after the take-off of the university in 2009 with the establishment of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology. The Electrical and Computer Engineering opened its doors for admission that year with two pioneering students drawn from the Faculty of Pure and Applied Science.

The department actually took off officially in January 2013 with the appointment of a Head of Department supported by a couple of Senior Adjunct Lecturers and some Assistant Lecturers. Immediately thereafter, the department quickly defined as its goal the production of well-trained engineers who can function well in a broad range of professional activities such as teaching, research and development, design, manufacturing, consultancy services, maintenance, operation, marketing, sales and management.

Henceforth, the department plans to cut across the established boundaries while working to provide deep support and collaboration with other disciplines.*/
